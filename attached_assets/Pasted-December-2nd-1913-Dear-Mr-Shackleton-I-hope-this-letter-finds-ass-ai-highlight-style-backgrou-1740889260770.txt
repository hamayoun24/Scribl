Dear Mr. Shackleton,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing about joining your upcoming expedition as a chef. I have heard a lot of incredible things about your boat voyage and I believe I would be an asset to your crew. I am a professional on a boat. Working individual and it had been my dream to cook professionally on a boat.

I believe I would be perfect for this job because I am a hard working individual and I have practiced for many years. Your expedition needs someone who can cook in difficult conditions and I am that person.

Sincerely,
